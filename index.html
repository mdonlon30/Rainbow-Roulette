    I am making a russian roulette gambling app. I am using html and css and Javascript. I have the html and css already done. I just need the javascript. 
    
    In my html, I have an element that contains the players current money. It has an id of "funds". The value of the players money will go here and it doesn't need to be labeled with a dollar sign by Javascript because I have an image of a dollar sign next to it in my html. The player will start with a value of 100 in their current money. Also, I have an element where the value of the current bet goes with an id of "current-bet". This also does not have to be labeled with a dollar sign because I have an dollar icon next to it in my html. The value of the player's current bet will start at 0 before they place their bet. 

    I have an input field with an id of "enter-bet" where players enter the amount they want to bet. The amount cannot exceed what they have in their "funds" element. In the html, their is a button next to the input field with an id of "place-bet". When clicked, this button is supposed to transfer the amount they entered from their "funds" to their "current-bet" element. Also, the element with id "betting-section" should disappear when the "place-bet" button is clicked. Also, when the place bet button is clicked, it will determine with chamber of the gun anywhere from 1 to 6 has the bullet. This will determine how many clicks of the fire button before the player loses their money. If the bullet is in the fourth chamber, the player will lose their money on the fourth click. 

    There is a fire button with an id of "fire". If they click fire and survive the bullet, their "current-bet" value will go up and they can fire the gun again. I want the winnings for each shot to be based off of a percentage. For instance, if they bet 100, the first click will make the "current-bet" go to 120, then 150, then 200, then 300, and their final prize on the last bullet will be 600. Please use these prize percentages for any bet that is entered. They will not fire the last bullet obviously. They will be alerted that they survived Russian Roulette and the 600 will be added to their "funds" element.

    There is another button with an id of "profit". This button can be clicked at any point of the game to add the value in the "current-bet" element back to the funds element allow the player to enter a new bet. I want it to alert the player to how much they profited by walking away from the game. When the player gets shot or takes profit, I want the "betting-section" element to reappear in display:flex. That is how I have it in my css.

    The last part of my game is that there is an element with an id of "chambers" that displays the remaining chambers in the gun. This element will start with a value of 6 and decrease by 1 every time the gun is fired. I the player gets shot or takes profit, it will reset to 6 for a new game.
